This is a multiplayer game or player vs cpu game. Each side has its own card deck. Each card can be deployed on a slot / multi-slots, which will cost some
resources. Each card has different attributes and effects:
	- Unit: When deployed will automatically walk to the other side and attack any enemy encountered
	- Tower: When deployed will appear on screen and shoot any enemy that gets into its shooting range

The current sprites are only used as temporary place holders and for demonstration purpose only.
