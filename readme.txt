About the game:
This is a multiplayer game or player vs cpu game. Each side has its own card deck. Each card can be deployed on a slot / multi-slots, which will cost some
resources. Each card has different attributes and effects:
	- Soldier: When deployed will automatically walk to the other side and attack any enemy encountered
	- Tower: When deployed will stay at the same place and shoot any enemies that get in its shooting range

This is a prototype of the game, so you can control both sides since there is no CPU or any other player yet. Dragging a card on each side onto that side's
slots to deploy unit. Each soldier costs 20 resource points, and each tower costs 50 points. If there is not enough resources, you won't be able to place 
the card.
